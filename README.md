# OOP-Projects
OOP using C++ by implementing "minigames" on the terminal. The whole purpose of these projects are to introduce <br>
the student to all of the main aspects of Object-Oriented Programming. The first 2 tasks are <br>
emulating the Monopoly board-game and the 2 latter a battle from the infamous Pokemon games. <br>
<br>
The learning process is as follows:<br>
<br>
* Structs & Functions
* Classes - Constructor/Destructor/Setters/Getters
* Inheritance & Friend Functions
* Polymorphism
